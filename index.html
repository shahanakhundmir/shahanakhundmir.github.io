											<h3>Short Summary</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I started coding when I was around 11, using a BBC Basic computer hooked up to an old black & white.<br> 
											We loaded our games from tapes and printed on a dot matrix that screeched everytime it moved to the next line.<br>
											We couldn't afford that computer, by chance we inherited it when a close friend emigrated and left it behind.<br>
											I learnt to code by copying from the back of the computer's user guide.<br>
											When I was young not many girls coded, but I was pretty determined to do what I loved.<br>
											<strong>So I believe that my journey was a lot of luck,<br>
											a lot of being in the right place at the right time, <br>
											but ...... that's how you get to the place that your meant to be.</strong>

											<h3>My Experience</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I began my career as a Java programmer, working in application support.<br>
										Leaving this when I had my kids, I spent the next five to six years working as a project manager in community projects.<br>
										Around five years ago, I set up <a href='https://www.facebook.com/thecookieboxuk'><strong>The Cookie Box</strong></a> which was my other passion of baking,<br>
										But 18 months ago I decided to give a career in Tech another go.
										Recently I worked for the charity sector on an analysis of funding to the BAME community after Covid-19.</p>

											<h3>Technical Skills</h3>
										</header>
										<p><br>
										My main language is <strong>Python</strong>, and I have focused on Python for data analysis, having done data analysis pojects.<br>
										My other languages and technical skills include:
										<ul>
											<li>HTML & CSS</li>
											<li>SQL</li>
											<li>Java (just a tiny bit)</li>
											<li>Dash</li>
											<li>Google Data Studio</li>

											<h3>Transferable Skills</h3>
										</header>
										<p><strong>Organised.</strong></p>
										<p>Having a big family, being organised has been my middle name. <strong>Diplomat</strong> is probably another.<br>
										I like to focus on projects and goals, and I was probably quite suited to my <strong>project manager</strong> role.<br>
										My business helped me to learn lot's of skills in time keeping and dealing with people and I enjoyed meeting people from all walks of life.<br>
										<strong>If you feel low, I have a baking recipe that can fix it.</strong>

											<h3>Gettting back to Tech</h3>
										</header>
										<p>It was August 2019 and I was at a cross-roads with my company & at the same time, my daughter Jannah was embarking on her own journey into Tech.<br>
											She <strong>dragged</strong> me to a Women in Tech event at IBM in Novemeber and we were the last to leave.<br>
											Inspired by the strong and talented women that I heard speaking, I decided to try coding again.<br>
											<strong>It began </strong>with a YouTube Python course, but I was quickly hooked.<br>
											Within a few months I had closed my business and set out to learn Python with a view to returning to Tech.</p>
											<p>Coding was something that I had always loved but convinced myself that I could not go back to.<br>
											Taking the first step is always the hardest, but if you do something you enjoy, the journey becomes easy.<br>
